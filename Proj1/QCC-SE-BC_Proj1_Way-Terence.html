      <h1>Iceland</h1>
      <p><span><em><strong>Iceland</strong></em></span> is a country of sharp contrasts- a place where fire and ice co-exist, where dark winters are offset by the summer's midnight sun.  It's a country where insular existence has spurred a rich and vibrant culture.</p>

        <p class>The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas.  From September to April, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow.</p>
        <p>The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights, is a natural phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field.  This releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks across the skies.</p>

        <p class="main-text-right">When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's namesake--namely, its 4,500 square miles of glacier.  Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-round and takes place mainly on the Sólheimajökull and Svínafellsjökull glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavik (and Skaftafell).</p>

        <ul class="bulletless">
          <li><em>End of Sentence</em>, by director Elfar Adalsteins, receives very positive reviews in leading film industry magazines such as Hollywood Reporter and Screen Daily, which picked it one of five buzzy titles from the Edinburgh International Film Festival which finished last weekend.

  The film’s two leading actors, John Hawkes and Logan Lerman, are also praised in both reviews. Hawkes has quite a few films under his belt and was nominated for an Oscar for Winter’s Bones and young Lerman is best known for his role in The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Icelandic actor Ólafur Darri Ólafsson also has a small part in <em>End of Sentence</em>.</li>
